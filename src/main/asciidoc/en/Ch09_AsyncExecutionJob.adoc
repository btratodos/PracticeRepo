[[Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob]]
= Asynchronous execution type job

[[Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_Prerequisite]]
[NOTE]
.Premise
====
As explained in <<Ch09_Introduction.adoc#Ch09_Introduction_HowToProceed, How to proceed with the tutorial>>,
it is assumed that asynchronous execution is performed for already created jobs.
Note that, asynchronous execution method includes <<Ch04_AsyncJobWithDB.adoc#Ch04_AsyncJobWithDB, Method which uses DB polling>> and
<<Ch04_AsyncJobWithWebContainer.adoc#Ch04_AsyncJobWithWeb, Method which uses Web container>>. +
However, it must be noted that the description is for explanation of asynchronous execution of job using DB polling.
====

[[Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_Overview]]
== Overview
Execute job asynchronously using DB polling.

Note that, since this section is based on {batch5_guide},
refer <<Ch04_AsyncJobWithDB.adoc#Ch04_AsyncJobWithDB, Asynchronous execution (DB polling)>> for details. +
Background, process overview and business specifications of the application to be created are omitted as jobs are already created as per <<Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_Prerequisite>>.

Asynchronous execution of the job by using DB polling is subsequently explained by the following procedure.

. <<Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_Preparation>>
. <<Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_StartAsyncBatchDeamon>>
. <<Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_JobRegistration>>
. <<Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_ExecutionResultCheck>>
. <<Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_StopAsyncBatchDeamon>>
. <<Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_ExecutionStatusCheck>>

[[Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_Preparation]]
== Preparation
Implement preparation to perform asynchronous execution (DB polling).

Operations to be implemented are as given below.

. <<Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_Preparation_Properties>>
. <<Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_Preparation_Bean>>
. <<Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_Preparation_Input>>

[[Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_Preparation_Properties]]
=== Polling process setting
Configure settings required for asynchronous execution by ``batch-application.properties``. +
Since {batch5_shortname} is already configured, a detail explanation is omitted.
For the explanation of each item, refer polling process settings of <<Ch04_AsyncJobWithDB.adoc#Ch04_AsyncJobWithDB_HowToUse_Config, Various settings>>.

|(1)
|Set the polling cycle (milliseconds). +
Here, specify 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).

|(2)
|Configure exit file path to stop asynchronous batch daemon. +
Since this tutorial is based on the assumption that it is implemented in Windows environment,
stop-async-batch-daemon file is placed under C:\tmp in this configuration.

|===

[[Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_Preparation_Bean]]
=== Job configuration
Job to be executed asynchronously is set to ``automaticJobRegistrar`` of ``async-batch-daemon.xml``.

As an example, configuration which specify <<Ch09_DBAccessJob.adoc#Ch09_DBAccessJob, Job which inputs or outputs data by accessing database>>(chunk model) is shown below.

.Explanation

|Sr. No.
|Explanation

|(1)	
|Specify a Bean definition file of job targeted for asynchronous execution. +
Wild cards  (\**/*) can also be used.
Please refer to precautions in <<Ch04_AsyncJobWithDB.adoc#Ch04_AsyncJobWithDB_HowToUse_Config_Job, Job settings>>
while specifying a job.

|===

[WARNING]
.Considerations while designing a job
====
Since it is possible to execute the same job in parallel as a characteristic of asynchronous execution (DB polling), it is necessary to prevent the impact of the same job while executing the jobs in parallel.

In this tutorial, the same job ID is used for database access job and file access job.
Although these jobs are not executed in parallel, in this tutorial, it should be kept in mind while designing a job
since an error is likely to occur if multiple jobs with the same job ID are specified.
====

[[Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_Preparation_Input]]
=== Input resource setting
Set an input resource (database or file) while executing a job asynchronously. +
Here, a job that uses normal data is executed.

Set an input resource for the job to access database and the job to access file.

//^
In case of a job which accesses database::
Set Database Initialize script of ``batch-application.proeprties`` as shown below.

[source, xml]
.src/main/resources/batch-application.proeprties
----
# Database Initialize
tutorial.create-table.script=file:sqls/create-member-info-table.sql
tutorial.insert-data.script=file:sqls/insert-member-info-data.sql
#tutorial.insert-data.script=file:sqls/insert-member-info-error-data.sql
----

//^
In case of a job which accesses a file::
It must be verified in advance that the input file is deployed and output directory exists.

* Input file
** files/input/input-member-info-data.csv
* Output directory
** files/output/

[NOTE]
.Regarding preparation of data for input resource in this tutorial
====
In case of a job which accesses database, execute INSERT SQL while starting asynchronous batch daemon (ApplicationContext generation)
and prepare the data in database.

In case of a job which accesses file, place input file in the directory,
and specify path of input/output file as the parameter part of the job information while registering job information in the job request table.
====

[[Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_StartAsyncBatchDeamon]]
== Start asynchronous batch daemon
Start ``AsyncBatchDaemon`` provided by {batch5_shortname}.

Create the execution configuration as shown below and start asynchronous batch daemon. +
Refer <<Ch09_EnvironmentConstruction.adoc#Ch09_EnvironmentConstruction_OperationCheck_ExecJob_RunConf,Create Run Configuration (Execution configuration)>> for the creation procedure.

[[Ch09_AsyncExecutionJob_JobRegistration]]
== Register job information in job request table
Issue a SQL (INSERT statement) to register information for executing the job
in job request table (batch_job_request).

For table specifications of job request table, refer job request table structure of <<Ch04_AsyncJobWithDB.adoc#Ch04_AsyncJobWithDB_Arch_RequireTable, Table for polling>>.
