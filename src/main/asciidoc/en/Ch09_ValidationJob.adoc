[[Ch09_ValidationJob]]
= A job that validates input data

[[Ch09_ValidationJob_Prerequisite]]
[NOTE]
.Premise
====
As explained in <<Ch09_Introduction.adoc#Ch09_Introduction_HowToProceed, How to proceed with the tutorial>>,
it will include implementation of the jobs for <<Ch09_DBAccessJob.adoc#Ch09_DBAccessJob, A job that inputs/outputs data by accessing a database>> 
and <<Ch09_FileAccessJob.adoc#Ch09_FileAccessJob, A job that inputs/outputs data by accessing a file. +
However, it must be noted that the description is for the case where the implementation is added to the job which accesses the database.
====

[[Ch09_ValidationJob_Overview]]
== Overview
Create a job that validates input data (hereafter, referred as input check).

Note that, since this section is based on {batch5_guide}, 
refer <<Ch06_InputValidation.adoc#Ch06_InputValidation, Input check>>,for details.

Background, process overview and business specifications of <<Ch09_TutorialApplication.adoc#Ch09_TutorialApplication, Description of the application to be created>>
are given below.

[[Ch09_ValidationJob_Overview_Background]]
=== Background
Some mass retail stores issue point cards for members. +
Membership types include "Gold member", "normal member" and the services are provided based on the membership types. +
As a part of the service, 100 points are added for "gold members" and 10 points are added for "normal members" at the end of the month, 
for the members who have purchased a product during that month.

[[Ch09_ValidationJob_Overview_ProcessOverview]]
=== Process overview
{batch5_shortname} will be using in an application as a monthly batch process
which adds points based on the membership type. +
Implement a process which verifies validity of whether the data exceeding upper limit value of points exists in input data.

[[Ch09_ValidationJob_Overview_BusinessSpecification]]
=== Business specifications
Business specifications are as given below.

* Check that points of input data do not exceed 1,000,000 points
** When an error occurs during the check, the process terminates abnormally (No exception handling)
* When the product purchasing flag is "1"(process target), points are added based on membership type
** Add 100 points when membership type is "G"(gold member) and add 10 points when membership type is "N"(Normal member)
* Product purchasing flag is updated to "0" (initial status) after adding points
* Upper limit of points is 1,000,000 points
* If the points exceed 1,000,000 after adding the points, they are adjusted to 1,000,000 points

[[Ch09_ValidationJob_Overview_TableSpecification]]
=== Table specifications
Specifications of member information table which serve as an input and output resource are as shown below. +
Since it acts as an explanation for a job which accesses the database as per <<Ch09_ValidationJob_Prerequisite>>,
refer <<Ch09_FileAccessJob.adoc#Ch09_FileAccessJob_Overview_FileSpecification,File specifications>> for resource specifications of input and output for a job accessing a file.

[[Ch09_ValidationJob_Overview_JobOverview]]
=== Job overview
The process flow and process sequence are shown below
to understand the overview of the job which performs input check created here.

Since it acts as an explanation for the job which accesses a database as per <<Ch09_ValidationJob_Prerequisite>>,
it must be noted that it is likely to be different from the process flow and process sequence for the job which access the file.

Input check is classified into unit item check and correlated item check etc., however only unit item checks are handled here. +
Use Bean Validation for unit item check.
For details, refer <<Ch06_InputValidation.adoc#Ch06_InputValidation_Overview_Category, Input check classification>>.

//^
Process flow overview:
Overview of process flow is shown below.

Process sequence in case of a chunk model::
Process sequence in case of a chunk model is explained. +
Since this job is explained by assuming the usage of abnormal data,
the sequence diagram shows occurrence of error (abnormal termination) during input check. +
When the input check is successful, process sequence after input check is same as sequence diagram of database access
(Refer <<Ch09_DBAccessJob.adoc#Ch09_DBAccessJob_Overview_JobOverview, Job overview>>.

In case of chunk model, input check is performed within the timing when data is passed to ``ItemProcessor``.

Orange colour object represents a class to be implemented at this time.

.Sequence diagram of chunk model
image::Ch09_ValidationJob_ProcessSequence_ChunkModel.png[ProcessSequence of Validation Job by ChunkModel]

.Explanation of sequence diagram
. A step is executed from the job.
. Step opens the resource
. ``MyBatisCursorItemReader`` fetches all the member information from member_info table (issue select statement).
** Repeat subsequent process until input data is exhausted.
** Start a framework transaction with the chunk units.
** Repeat steps from 4 to 12 until the chunk size is achieved.
. Step fetches one record of input data from ``MyBatisCursorItemReader``.
. ``MyBatisCursorItemReader`` fetches one record of input data from member_info table.
. member_info table returns input data to ``MyBatisCursorItemReader``.
. ``MyBatisCursorItemReader`` returns the input data to step.
. Step processes input data by ``PointAddItemProcessor``.
. ``PointAddItemProcessor`` requests ``SpringValidator`` for input check.
. ``SpringValidator`` performs input check based on input check rules and throws an exception (ValidationException) in case an error occurs during the check.
. ``PointAddItemProcessor`` reads input data and adds points.
. ``PointAddItemProcessor`` returns process results to the step.
. Step outputs chunk size data by ``MyBatisBatchItemWriter``.
. ``MyBatisBatchItemWriter`` updates member information for member_info table ((issue update statement).

** When **an exception occurs** in the processes from 4 to 14, perform following process.

[start=15]
. Step rolls back framework transaction.
. Step returns an exit code (here, abnormal end: 255) to the job.

//^
Process sequence for a tasklet model::
Process sequence for the tasklet model is explained. +
Since this job is described assuming the usage of abnormal system data,
the sequence diagram shows a case when an error has occurred in input check (Abnormal end). +
When the input check is successful, process sequence after the input check is same as sequence diagram of database access
(Refer <<Ch09_DBAccessJob.adoc#Ch09_DBAccessJob_Overview_JobOverview, Job overview>>).

In case of a tasklet model, input check is performed within any timing in ``Tasklet#execute()``. +
Here, it is done immediately after fetching the data.

Orange object shows a class to be implemented at this time.

.Sequence diagram of tasklet model
image::Ch09_ValidationJob_ProcessSequence_TaskletModel.png[ProcessSequence of Validation Job by TaskletModel]

.Explanation of sequence diagram
. A step is executed from the job.
** Step starts a framework transaction.
. Step executes ``PointAddTasklet``.
. ``PointAddTasklet`` opens a resource.
. ``MyBatisCursorItemReader`` fetches all the member information (issue select statement) from member_info table.
** Repeat steps from 5 to 13 until the input data is exhausted.
** Repeat processes from 5 to 11 until a fixed number of records is achieved.
. ``PointAddTasklet`` fetches one record of input data from ``MyBatisCursorItemReader``.
. ``MyBatisCursorItemReader`` fetches 1 record of input data from member_info table.
. member_info table returns input data to ``MyBatisCursorItemReader``.
. ``MyBatisCursorItemReader`` returns input data to tasklet.
. ``PointAddTasklet`` requests ``SpringValidator`` for input check.
. ``SpringValidator`` performs input check based on input check rules and throws an exception (ValidationException) when an error occurs during a check.
. ``PointAddTasklet`` reads input data and adds points.
. ``PointAddTasklet` outputs data of fixed records by ``MyBatisBatchItemWriter``.
. ``MyBatisBatchItemWriter`` updates member information for member_info table (issue update statement).

** When **an exception occurs** in the processes from 2 to 13, perform following process.

[start=14]
. ``PointAddTasklet`` throws an exception (Here, ValidationException) in the step.
. Step rolls back the framework transaction.
. Step returns an exit code (Here, abnormal end: 255) to the job.

[NOTE]
.Setting for implementing input check process
====
Use Hibernate Validator in input check. Although it is configured  already in {batch5_shortname},
Hibernate Validator and Bean must be defined in the dependency relation of the library.

[[Ch09_ValidationJob_Chunk]]
== Implementation in Chunk model
Execute the job which performs input check in the chunk model, from its creation to execution using following procedure.

. <<Ch09_ValidationJob_Chunk_ValidationRulesDefinition>>
. <<Ch09_ValidationJob_Chunk_Coding>>
. <<Ch09_ValidationJob_Chunk_Execution>>

[[Ch09_ValidationJob_Chunk_ValidationRulesDefinition]]
=== Defining input check rules
Assign Bean Validation annotation to the field for checking DTO class in order to perform input check. +
For annotation for input checks, refer link:{server5_url}/ArchitectureInDetail/WebApplicationDetail/Validation.html#validation-jsr303-doc[Bean Validation check rules] and 
link:{server5_url}/ArchitectureInDetail/WebApplicationDetail/Validation.html#validation-validator-list[Hibernate Validator check rules] of {server5_guide}.

Since it is used in common for Chunk model / Tasklet model, it can be skipped if it has already been implemented.

Here, define a check rule to check whether points exceed 1,000,000 (upper limit value).

[[Ch09_ValidationJob_Chunk_Coding]]
=== Implementation of input check process
Implement input check process in business logic class which adds the points.

Add implementation of input check process to already implemented ``PointAddItemProcessor`` class. +
Since it acts as an explanation for a job which accesses the database as per <<Ch09_ValidationJob_Prerequisite>>, add only (1)~(3) from below
to the implementation for the job accessing the file.

        // The other codes of business logic are omitted.
    }
}
----

[cols="10,90", options="header"]
.Explanation
|===
|Sr. No.
|Explanation

|(1)
|Inject an instance of ``SpringValidator``.

|(2)
|Set DTO to be fetched through ``ItemReader``in the type argument of
``org.springframework.batch.item.validator.Validator`.

|(3)
|Execute ``Validator#validate()`` by using DTO fetched through ``ItemReader`` as an argument. +
Originally, try-catch was implemented to handle input check error and catch the exception while executing ``validate()``,
however, since exception handling using try-catch is explained in <<Ch09_ExceptionHandlingWithTryCatchJob.adoc#Ch09_ExceptionHandlingWithTryCatchJob, Job performing exception handling by try-catch>>,
exception handling is not implemented here.

[[Ch09_ValidationJob_Chunk_Execution]]
=== Job execution and result verification
Execute the created job on STS and verify the results.

[[Ch09_ValidationJob_Chunk_Execution_Run]]
==== Execute the job from execution configuration
Execute the job from execution configuration which is created in advance.

Here, the job is executed by using abnormal data. +
Since how to change input data varies according to resource (database or file) which handles a job performing input check,
execute as below.

//^
When input check is implemented for the job which inputs or outputs data by accessing database ::
Execute job by using execution configuration created in <<Ch09_DBAccessJob.adoc#Ch09_DBAccessJob_Chunk_Execution_Run, Execute job from execution configuration>>
of the job which inputs or outputs data by accessing database.

In order to use abnormal system data, comment out script of normal system data and remove comment out of abnormal system data 
by Database Initialize of ``batch-application.properties``.

When input check is implemented for the job which inputs or outputs data by accessing a file::
Execute job by using execution configuration created in <<Ch09_FileAccessJob.adoc#Ch09_FileAccessJob_Chunk_Execution_Run, Execute job from execution configuration>>
of the job which inputs or outputs data by accessing a file.

In order to use abnormal system data, change path of input file (inputFile) from normal system data (insert-member-info-data.csv) to abnormal system data (insert-member-info-error-data.csv),
from the arguments set in execution configuration.
