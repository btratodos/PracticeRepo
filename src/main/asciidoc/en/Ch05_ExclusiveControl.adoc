[[Ch05_ExclusiveControl_Overview]]
== Overview
Exclusive control is a process performed to maintain consistency of data when update processing is performed simultaneously for the same resource from multiple transactions.
In the case where there is a possibility that updating processing is performed simultaneously for the same resource from multiple transactions, it is basically necessary to perform exclusive control.

Multiple transaction means following in this chapter.

* Transaction at the time of simultaneous execution of multiple jobs
* Transaction at the time of simultaneous execution with online processing

[IMPORTANT]
.Exclusive control of multiple jobs
====
When multiple jobs are executed at the same time, it is fundamental to design jobs so that exclusive control is not required.
This means that it is basic to divide the resources to be accessed and the processing target for each job.
====

Since the concept of exclusive control is the same as online processing,
please refer to {server5_url}/ArchitectureInDetail/DataAccessDetail/ExclusionControl.html[Exclusive Control] in {server5_guide}

Here, focus on the part not described in {server5_shortname}.

The usage method of this function is same in the chunk model as well as tasklet model.

[[Ch05_ExclusiveControl_Overview_Necessity]]
=== Necessity of Exclusive Control
For the necessity of exclusive control,
please refer to {server5_url}/ArchitectureInDetail/DataAccessDetail/ExclusionControl.html#exclusioncontrol-necessity[Necessity of Exclusive Control] in {server5_guide}.

[[Ch05_ExclusiveControl_Overview_File]]
=== Exclusive Control for File
Exclusive control for file is generally implemented by file locking.

File Locking::
  File locking is a mechanism for restricting reading and writing from other programs while using files with a certain program.
  The outline of file lock processing is as follows.

.Scenario
  ** The batch process A acquires the lock of the file and starts the file updating process.
  ** Batch process B attempts to update the same file and attempts to acquire the file lock fails.
  ** The batch process A ends the processing and unlocks the file

.Overview of File Lock Processing
image::Ch05_ExclusiveControl_File_Senario.png[ExclusiveControl_File_Senario]

. The Batch Process A tries to acquire the lock of the Target File.
. The Batch Process A succeeds in acquiring the lock of the Target File.
. The Batch Process B tries to acquire the lock of the Target File.
. The Batch Process A writes the Target File.
. Since the Batch Process A is locked the Target File, the Batch Process B fails to acquire the lock of the Target File.
. The Batch Process B performs processing of file update failure.
. The Batch Process A releases the lock of the Target File.

[IMPORTANT]
.Prevention of Deadlock
====
Even in a file,in the same as a database, when acquiring a lock on multiple files, deadlock may occur in some cases.
Therefore, it is important to make a rule the update order of files. +
The prevention of deadlock is similar to prevention of deadlock between tables in the database.
For details, refer to
{server5_url}/ArchitectureInDetail/DataAccessDetail/ExclusionControl.html#id9[Prevention of deadlock] in {server5_guide}.

=== Relationship between Exclusive Control and Components
The relationship between each component provided by {batch5_shortname} and exclusive control is as follows.

[CAUTION]
.Optimistic lock on files
====
Because of the characteristic of the file, do not apply optimistic lock on files.

|ItemProcessor
|
|Since it is fundamental to handle locked data, in principle, exclusive control is not performed here.

|ItemWriter
|-
|Update data without conscious of exclusion.

|Tasklet
|Tasklet
|Get a file lock right after opening a file with ItemStreamReader. +
Release the file lock just before closing ItemStreamWriter.
|When acquiring data, execute the processing described in the ItemReader section, and when updating the data, the processing described in ItemWriter section. +
The concept is the same when using the Mapper interface directly.

|===

[IMPORTANT]
.Pessimistic lock on file
====
Pessimistic lock on files should be implemented in the tasklet model.
In the chunk model, due to its structure, there is a period that can not be excluded in the gap of chunk processing.
Also, it is assumed that file access is done by Injecting ItemStreamReader / ItemStreamWriter.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Waiting time due to Pessimistic lock in database
====
When pessimistic locking is performed, the wait time for processing due to contention may be prolonged.
In that case, it is reasonable to use the pessimistic lock by specifying the NO WAIT option and the timeout time.
====

[[Ch05_ExclusiveControl_HowToUse_File]]
=== Exclusive control of file
Exclusive control of file with {batch5_shortname} is realized by implementing Tasklet.
As a means of achieving exclusion, exclusive control is performed by file lock acquisition using the ``java.nio.channels.FileChannel`` class.

[NOTE]
.Details of the FileChannel class
====
For details and how to use ``FileChannel`` class,
refer to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.html[Javadoc].
====

Show an example of using ``FileChannel`` class to get a file lock.

|===

[NOTE]
.About the method of FileChannel used for lock acquisition
====
It is recommended to use the ``tryLock()`` method which is not waiting because the ``lock()`` method waits until the lock is released if the target file is locked.
Note that trylock() can select shared lock and exclusive lock, but in batch processing, exclusive lock is normally used.
====

[WARNING]
.Exclusive control between threads in the same VM
====
Attention must be paid to exclusive control between threads in the same VM.
When processing files between threads in the same VM, the lock function using the ``FileChannel`` class can not determine whether a file is locked by another thread's processing. +
Therefore, exclusive control between threads does not function. In order to avoid this, exclusive control between threads can be performed by performing synchronization processing in the part where writing to the file is performed. +
However, synchronizing reduces the merit of parallel processing, and it is not different from processing with a single thread.
As a result, since it is not suitable to perform exclusive control with different threads on the same file and process it, do not design and implement such processing.
====

[TIP]
.About appendAllowed property of FlatFileItemWriter
====
When creating (overwriting) a file, exclusive control can be realized by setting the ``appendAllowed`` property to ``false`` (default).
This is because ``FileChannel`` is controlled inside ``FlatFileItemWriter``.
However, if the file is appended (``appendAllowed`` property is ``true``), developers need to implement exclusive control with ``FileChannel``.
