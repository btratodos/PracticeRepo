= Synchronous job

[[Ch04_SyncJob_Overview]]
== Overview

Synchronous job is explained.
Synchronous job is the execution method of launching a new process through shell by job scheduler and returning the execution result of the job to the caller.

The usage method of this function is same in the chunk model as well as tasklet model.

[[Ch04_SyncJob_HowToUse]]
== How to use

How to running a job by ``CommandLineJobRunner`` is explained.

Refer to <<Ch03_CreateProject.adoc#Ch03_CreateProject, Create project>> for building and executing the application.
Refer to <<Ch04_JobParameter.adoc#, Job parameters>> for how to specify and use job parameters.
Some explanation given in the above reference and in this section overlap however, the elements of synchronous job are mainly explained.

[[Ch04_SyncJob_HowToUse_Run]]
=== How to run

In {batch5_shortname}, run the synchronous job using ``CommandLineJobRunner`` provided by {SB}.
Start ``CommandLineJobRunner`` by issuing java command as shown below.

.Items to be specified by the arguments
|===
|Items to be specified
|Explanation
|Required

|jobPath
|Bean definition file path where the settings of the job to be run are described. Specify by relative path from classpath.
|icon:check[]

|options
|Specify various options (stop, restart etc.) at the time of launching.
|

|jobIdentifier
|Specify job name in Bean definition or job run ID after job execution as the job identifier.
Normally, specify job name. Specify job run ID only when specifying stop and restart options.
|icon:check[]

|jobParameters
|Specify job arguments. Specify in ``key=value`` format.

|===
|Sr. No.
|Explanation

|(1)
|Specify the batch application jar and dependent jar in ``classpath`` at the time of executing ``java`` command.
 Here, it is specified by command arguments however, environment variables can also be used.

|(2)
|Specify ``CommandLineJobRunner`` with FQCN in the class to be run.

|(3)
|Pass the run arguments along the ``CommandLineJobRunner``.
Here, 2 job names are specified as ``jobPath`` and ``jobIdentifier``.

|(1)
|``target=server1`` and ``outputFile=/tmp/result.csv`` are specified as job running parameters.

[[Ch04_SyncJob_HowToUse_Options]]
=== Options

Supplement the options indicated in <<Ch04_SyncJob_HowToUse_Run_Syntax>>.

In ``CommandLineJobRunner``, the following 4 launch options can be used.
Here, only the overview of each option is explained.

-restart::
  Restarts the failed job. Refer to <<Ch06_ReProcessing.adoc#,Reprocessing>> for the details.
-stop::
  Stops a running job. Refer to <<Ch07_JobManagement.adoc#,Job management>> for the details.
-abandon::
  Abandons a stopped job. The abandoned job cannot be restarted.
  In {batch5_shortname}, there is no case of using this option, hence it is not explained.
-next::
  Runs the job executed once in the past, again. However, in {batch5_shortname}, this option is not used. +
  In {batch5_shortname}, it is for avoiding the restriction "Running the job by the same parameter is recognized as the same job and the same job can be executed only once"
  that is given by default in {SB}. +
  The details are explained in <<Ch04_JobParameter.adoc#Ch04_JobParameter_HowToUse_Converter, regarding parameter conversion class>>. +
  For using this option, implementation class of ``JobParametersIncrementer`` interface is required,
  it is not set in{batch5_shortname}. +
  Therefore, when this option is specified and launched, an error occurs because the required Bean definition does not exist.
