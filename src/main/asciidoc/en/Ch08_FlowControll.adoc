[[Ch08_FCh08_FlowControll_Overview]]
== Overview

It is a method of implementing a single business process by splitting one job to multiple jobs and combining them
instead of implementing by integrating them in one job.
The item wherein dependency relationship between jobs is defined, is called as job net.

The advantages of defining a job net are enumerated below.

* It is easier to visualize progress status of a process
* It is possible to do partial re-execution,  pending execution and stop execution of jobs
* It is easier to do parallel execution of jobs

When designing a batch process, it is common to design the job net and the jobs together.

[IMPORTANT]
.Suitability of processing contents and job net
====
Job nets are often not suitable for simple business process that need not be split and the process for integrating with online process.
====

In this guideline, control of the flow of jobs between job nets is called flow control.
In the processing flow, the previous job is called as preceding job and the next job is called as subsequent job.
The dependency relationship between the preceding job and the subsequent job is called preceding and succeeding relationship.

The conceptual diagram of flow control is shown below.

.Overview of flow control
image::Ch08_FlowControl_Overview.png[Flow Control Overview]

As shown above, flow control can be implemented by both the job scheduler and {batch5_shortname}.
However, it is desirable to use the job scheduler as much as possible due to the following reasons.

.When implemented in {batch5_shortname}
* There is a strong tendency to have diverse processes and status for one job making it easier to form a black box.
* The boundary between the job scheduler and the job becomes ambiguous
* It becomes difficult to see the situation at the time of error from the job scheduler

However, it is generally known that there are following disadvantages when the number of jobs defined in the job scheduler increases.

* The cost mentioned below increases and the processing time of the entire system increases due to the job scheduler
** Job scheduler product specific communication, control of execution node, etc.
** Overhead cost associated with Java process start for each job
* Number of job registrations limit

The policy is as follows.

* Basically, flow control is performed by the job scheduler.
* Following measures are taken only when any damage is caused due to the large number of jobs.
** Multiple sequential processes are consolidated in one job in {batch5_shortname}.
*** Simple preceding and succeeding relationships are only consolidated in one job.
*** Changing the step exit code and conditional branch of executing subsequent step by it can be used functionally.
However, because job execution management becomes complicated,
it is used in principle only for the process exit code determination at the end of the job.

[TIP]
====
Refer to <<Ch07_JobManagement.adoc#Ch07_JobManagement_ExitCode, "Customization of exit code">> for the details of deciding job exit code.
====

The points to be considered for implementing preceding and succeeding process are shown below.

.Difference between job scheduler and {batch5_shortname}

.Flow control by job scheduler
image::ch08/FlowControl/Ch08_FlowControl_Jobnet.png[Job net]

.Points to be considered
* Job scheduler starts java process through shell.
* One job should correspond to one java process.
** In the entire process, 4 java processes start.
* The job scheduler controls the start order of each process. Each java process is independent.
* The process exit code of the preceding job is used for deciding the start of the succeeding job.
* External resources such as files, DB etc. should be used to pass the data between jobs.

.Flow control by {batch5_shortname}
image::ch08/FlowControl/Ch08_FlowControl_StepExecution.png[FlowControl]

.Points to be considered
* Job scheduler starts java process through shell.
* One job should be one java process.
** In the entire process, only one java process is used.
* Start order of each step is controlled by one java process. Each step is independent.
* The exit code of the preceding job is used for deciding the start of the succeeding job.
* The data can be passed between steps by in-memory.

How to implement flow control by {batch5_shortname} is explained below. +
The flow control of job scheduler is strongly dependent on the product specifications so it is not explained here.

[TIP]
.Application example of flow control
====
In general, parallel/multiple processes of multiple jobs is often implemented by job scheduler and job net. +
However, in {batch5_shortname}, how to implement parallel and multiple processes of multiple jobs by applying the flow control function, is explained.
Refer to <<Ch08_ParallelAndMultiple.adoc#Ch08_ParallelAndMultiple, "Parallel and multiple process">> for details.
====

The usage method of this function is same in the chunk model as well as tasklet model.

[[Ch08_FCh08_FlowControll_HowToUse]]
== How to use
How to use flow control in {batch5_shortname} is explained.

[[Ch08_FCh08_FlowControll_HowToUse_SequencialFlow]]
=== Sequential flow

Sequential flow is a flow that links the before step and after step in series. +
If any business process ends abnormally in a step of the sequential flow, the succeeding step is not executed and the job is interrupted.
In this case, the step and job status and exit code associated with the job execution ID are
recorded as ``FAILED`` by `` JobRepository``. +
By restarting after recovering the cause of failure, it is possible to resume the process from the abnormally ended step.

[TIP]
====
Refer to <<Ch06_ReProcessing.adoc#Ch06_RerunRestart_HowToUse_Restart, "Job restart">> for how to restart a job.
====

Set sequential flow of the job consisting of 3 steps.

[[Ch08_FCh08_FlowControll_HowToUse_PassingDataToFutureSteps]]
=== Passing data between steps

In {SB}, ``ExecutionContext`` of execution context that can be used in the scope of each step and job is provided.
By using the step execution context, data can be shared between the components in the step.
At this time, since the step execution context cannot be shared between steps, the preceding step execution context cannot be referred from the succeeding step execution context.
It can be implemented if the job execution context is used, but since it can be referred from all steps, it needsto be handled carefully.
When the information between the steps needs to be inherited, it can be done by the following procedure.

. In the post-processing of the preceding step, the information stored in the step execution context is passed to the job execution context.
. The succeeding step gets information from the job execution context.

By using ``ExecutionContextPromotionListener`` provided by {SB},
the first procedure can be realized only by specifying the inherited information to the listener even without implementing it.

[WARNING]
.Notes on using ExecutionContext
====
`` ExecutionContext`` used for passing data is saved in serialized state in
``BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_CONTEXT`` and ``BATCH_JOB_STEP_EXECUTION_CONTEXT`` of RDBMS
so note the following 3 points.

. The passed data should be an object in a serializable format.
  * ``java.io.Serializable`` should be implemented.
. Minimum required passed data should be retained. +
  `` ExecutionContext`` is also used for storing execution control information by {SB},
   so larger the passed data, the more the serialization cost. +
. The above `` ExecutionContextPromotionListener`` should be used for passed data without saving it directly in the job execution context. +
  The job execution context has a wider scope than the step execution context, unnecessary serialized data gets easily accumulated.

Also, it is possible to exchange information by sharing Bean of Singleton or Job scope rather than going through the execution context.
Note that the larger the size of this method more the pressure on memory resources.
====

The data passed between steps is explained for the tasklet model and the chunk model respectively below.

[[Ch08_FCh08_FlowControll_HowToUse_PassingDataToFutureSteps_Tasklet]]

====
``ExecutionContextPromotionListener`` passes the data from step execution context to job execution context
only when the step exit code of data passing source ends normally (``COMPLETED``). +

|(1)
|Do not specify ``next`` attribute in the ``<batch:step>`` element as in the sequential flow.
By setting multiple ``<batch:next>``, it can be assigned to the succeeding step specified by ``to`` attribute. +
Specify exit code of the step  that is the transition condition, in ``on``.

|(2)
|It is the succeeding step executed only when the step exit code of (1) is ``COMPLETED``.

|(3)
|It is the succeeding step executed only when the step exit code of (1) is ``FAILED``. +
By specifying this, succeeding step such as recovery process etc. is executed without stopping the job when the preceding stepprocess fails.

|===

[WARNING]
.Notes on recovery process by after steps
====
When recovery process of the succeeding step is performed due to failure of preceding step process (Exit code is ``FAILED``),
the status of before step changes to ``ABANDONED`` and it cannot restart regardless of success or failure of the recovery process.

When the recovery process of the succeeding step fails, only the recovery process is re-executed on restarting the job. +
For this reason, when processing is to be performed again including the preceding step, it is necessary to rerun as anotherjob execution.
====

[[Ch08_FCh08_FlowControll_StopConfig]]
=== Stop condition

How to stop the job depending on the exit code of the preceding step, is explained. +
There are methods to specify the following 3 elements as means to stop.

. ``end``
. ``fail``
. ``stop``

If these exit codes correspond to the preceding step, the succeeding step is not executed. +
Multiple exit codes can be specified within the same step.

.Explanation of setting contents of job stop
|===
|Sr. No.
|Explanation

|(1)
|When ``on`` attribute of ``<batch:end>`` and the step exit code match, the job is recorded as normal end
(Status : ``COMPLETED``) in ``JobRepository``. +
When ``exit-code`` attribute is assigned, exit code of job can be customized from ``COMPLETED`` by default.

|(2)
|By specifying wildcard (``*``) in ``on`` attribute of ``<batch:next>``, when it does not correspond to any of ``end``, ``fail``,
``stop``, subsequent job can be continued. +
It is described at the end of step elements however, since matching condition of exist code is evaluated before,
the arrangement order of elements is optional if it is within step elements.

|(3)
|When ``<batch:fail>`` is used, the job is recorded as abnormal end (Status: ``FAILED``) in ``JobRepository``. +
Like ``<batch:end>``, by assigning ``exit-code`` attribute, exit code of job can be customized from ``FAILED`` by default.

|(4)
|When ``<batch:stop>`` is used, the job is recorded as stopped (Status: ``STOPPED``) in ``JobRepository`` at the time ofnormal end of step. +
For ``restart`` attribute, specify the stop where the job is resumed from stop at the time of restart. +
Like ``<batch:end>``, ``exit-code`` attribute can be assigned, however, null string should be specified.(refer to column later)

|===


[IMPORTANT]
.When customizing the exit code by the exit-code attribute, it should be mapped to the process exit code without omission.
====
Refer to <<Ch07_JobManagement.adoc#Ch07_JobManagement_ExitCode,"Customization of exit code">> for details.
====

[WARNING]
.Empty charactor string should be specified to exit-code in <batch:stop>.

----
<step id="step1" parent="s1">

</step>

<step id="step2" parent="s2"/>
----

The expected flow control should be that when step1 ends normally, the job stops and step2 is executed when restart is executed again. +
However, due to some failure in {SB}, the operation does not take place as expected. +
step2 is not executed after restart, the exit code of job becomes ``NOOP`` and status ``COMPLETED``.

To avoid this, "" (empty charactor string) should be assigned in ``exit-code`` as shown above.

Refer to https://jira.spring.io/browse/BATCH-2315[{SB}/BATCH-2315] for the details of failure.
